## IN PROGRESS

- [ ] Interpolate missing beats
- [ ] Limit number of interpolation loops to a 'reasonable' number based on max BPM * 16beats/measure (or somesuch)
- [ ] --no-quantize
- [ ] Estimate BPM and offset
- [ ] Exponential forgetting factor
- [ ] Adjust for latency (--latency)
- [ ] Web page
- [ ] JSON output

- [x] Extend beats to min/max

## TODO

1. Look at beat detection algorithms
